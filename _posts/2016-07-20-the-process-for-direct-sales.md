The Collision Conference is being held in Toronto for 2024. Many companies, investors, startups and developers will be coming together at the Enercare Centre.


## Event Description

Collision, one of the world's biggest tech conferences, returns to Toronto from June 17-20, 2024. Collision brings together the brightest minds in tech and offers an excellent venue to showcase new and innovative technologies and to connect with global business opportunities. It is anticipated that more than 40,000 tech and innovation enthusiasts will attend Collision.

Since 2019, our network of Trade Commissioners has recruited dozens of global multinational enterprises, companies and international investors to meet with Canadian companies though our business-to-business (B2B) program at Collision. In 2023, this program resulted in over 700+ business meetings, facilitating many new international business connections and leads for our Canadian clients.

Once again, the Trade Commissioner Service will leverage this event to organize a B2B matchmaking program, Innovate with Canada, to connect cutting-edge Canadian technology companies with global corporate technology buyers and venture capital (VC) investors. There are two components to our B2B program this year. You are invited to participate in one or both:

June 11 to 13: Virtual B2Bs between Canadian companies and international delegates
June 18 to 20: In-person and virtual B2Bs between Canadian companies and international delegatesFootnote*
In addition to our B2B program, we are bringing to you an exciting roundup of seminars, geared to help you take your business global
